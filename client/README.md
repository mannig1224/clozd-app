# About

A client has user data for all of their employees that they would like to visualize. Theyâ€™ve asked
to be able to go through a summary of all the data in list format and also to be able to see any
single user in detail.

# Outcome
- [x] 7000 users
- [x] List summary - include full name, email, and city/country
- [x] Detailed summary - Include photo, full name, email, full address, phone number, and date of birth

# Installation

`npm i`

`npm start`

# Dependencies Used

    - axios
    - react-modal
    - bootstrap

# Side notes

    - it would be cool to add a sorting feature to the list
    - need to work on making the app more efficient,since we are working with 7000 users
    - need to work on styling
    - smaller row sizes for list view to make it easier to navigate all 200 users on one page
    - pagination could use some work on looking better

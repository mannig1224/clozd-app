# About

A client has user data for all of their employees that they would like to visualize. They’ve asked
to be able to go through a summary of all the data in list format and also to be able to see any
single user in detail.

# Outcome

There should be one main page with the users data listed. The client should be able to click on a user in the list and navigate to a details page where they can view more information.
● Main page
○ List summary - include full name, email, and city/country
● Details page
○ Include photo, full name, email, full address, phone number, and date of birth

# Installation

`npm i`

`npm start`

# Dependencies Used

    - axios
    - react-modal
    - bootstrap

# Side notes

    it would be cool to add a sorting feature to the list.
